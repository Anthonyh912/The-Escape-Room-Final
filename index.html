                <p class="hello">
                Welcome to the Escape Room a game dedicated to the point of view of a foster care child. Yearly children are placed in foster care systems under terrible living conditions, and are neglected. They are roughly impacted as the child may suffer from mal nutrition, drug abuse as well as mental and physical abuse. At the age of 18 the child is considered an adult and has absolutely no support and will most likely end up homeless, or if not in a shelter. Your job is to leave the system and enjoy your new life... Good Luck!

            You must leave this place before it's too late. But how will you escape without getting caught? Do you just simply walk out the door like everyone else or will you climb out your bedroom window so no one will notice?

                Oh no! You were caught by your Foster Mom. You try to make up an excuse and she buys it! You say you're going out to a friends house to do homework. You were unable to bring your bags and extra clothes so you go with only what you have on.

                Many foster care kids just live their lives without knowing what they want to do, or where they want to go. They feel as if in a way there is no point in trying because they're alone and they do not have people encouaraging them.There has to be more ways to help, and we need to do it NOW!
